## About Me
Hey, this is Lucas. I am a Mechanical Engineering working in the energy sector.
I want to improve my programming skills to help more people in their work.
Since university, I could see how people in many companies suffer from tiresome processes that could be fully automated, reducing the work load and stress from them and letting them focus on what's really important.
In my work, I can see it as weel. But so far I have only work with one end of the programming spectrum, getting processed data and showing in a beautiful dashboard or training an algorithm for a specific purpose.
As I had some work experience with BI and my thesis involved Machine Learning, I was able to dive deep into these areas, but I lack the Full Stack approach to think from the beginning, since the data acquisition, to the data storage, to the data processing, etc.
This is my goal, to get to know more programming areas and lead an IT team in my company to further develop solutions to automate data pipelines.
## Interests
I enjoy spending my free time reading, watching movies and playing.
Walking on the park, eating in a good restaurant and drinking a fine beer fill my heart with joy.
I am also learning italian and german. 
## Current Projects
* I am currently taking part in a Ada Tech Data Engineering program. The program is sponsored by Santander!ðŸ‘€
* I also work in the energy sector, developing solutions to make my colleagues' lifes easier. 
## Technical Skills
* My thesis involved training ML algorithms in the context of Predictive Maintenance, which involved reading and processing data from day to day operation of big and expensive machines to predict when a maintenance should occur before the machine fails 
* During my studies, I had work experience with BI, creating Excel and later PowerBI dashboards
